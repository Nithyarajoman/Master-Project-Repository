# Master-Project-Repository

This repository contains the codes that were created for the Master project of DNN mapping on NoC. The below are the functions implemented for obtaining the statistics required for mapping:

1. MAC operations of each layer
2. Memory required by each layer
3. Probability of non-zero data transmitted between each layer
4. Output size of each layer
5. Weight non-sparsity probability of each layer
6. Convolutional layer split along z-axis and y-axis

The data retrieved from the above first four functions are used to calculate the packets that has to be send between the different nodes in the defined network. The xml files required for the execution of the data transfer using simulator Ratatoskr (for more details refer https://github.com/jmjos/ratatoskr) are generated by a python function developed. 

Additional the case studies with the configuration files and results are included.
